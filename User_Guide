##Mimir User Guide (Interactive Companion) 

Mimir is a device that can be place in one’s room. It is small enough to fit on a desk, bedside table or a shelf.  

From there, it is permanently on and in standby until the user begins the interaction by pressing a button and making it “wake up”. Upon “waking up”, it has two main functions: 

 - Read my mood (RMM) 

 - Change my mood (CMM) 

 

###Read my mood  

Uses biological functions to figure out how the user is feeling. This is done via checking the person’s heartrate and skin moisture level. The user does it by holding Mimir and placing their fingers on the grips that use PPG sensor for the heart rate and galvanic skin sensors for skin moisture to read this information and estimate the user’s mood.  

After calculating what Mimir thinks the emotion level of the user is, it will announce the level by demonstrating on the scale where the person is using something like LEDs adjacent to the dial. 

 

###Change my mood  

Requires the RMM feature and the user certain the level of arousal they want. Then the device will try and help the user so that they move away from their current emotional level to their desired level. 

Mimir will inform the user that to end the interaction they will need to press a button, that will be made obvious on the device. 

Currently, the desired level of emotion ranges from calm to hype and there are multiple levels between the extremes of the two. Different interaction will take place depending on the difference between the current and desired level and how intense the desired level is. 

*Calm* 

When the target level is calm, the CMM will:  

 - Play calming music / white noise; 

 - Have soft lighting; 

 - Ask probing questions to allow the user to silently self-reflect; 

 - Walk user through deep breathes; 

 - Describe calming environments for user to imagine; 

 - Encourage drinking water. 

This is led by the “calm persona”. The inspiration for this persona is Master Oogway from Kung Fu Panda. The E-ink Screen will display various things depending on the level but will include things like faces (emoji), water droplet, music note, wind lines, sun. 

 

*Hype* 

When the target level is hype, the CMM will:  

 - Play more upbeat music with a faster BPM; 

 - Positive affirmations that will need to be repeated back; 

 - Encourage movement / dance; 

 - Play a game that speeds up such as an ice breaker trivia. 

This is led by the “hype persona”. The inspiration for this persona is Shia LaBoeuf from the iconic “Just Do It!” video. The E-ink Screen will display various things depending on the level but will include things like faces (emojis), music notes, dancing person, dice. 

 

###Levels 

The emotional levels will range from calm (-3) to hype (3). The RMM will be able to evaluate the mood to be a 0 but the user isn’t able to choose 0 as the mood they want to be at. 

 - -3 (Calm) 
 - -2 
 - -1 
 - 0: User can’t set it to 0 but can be evaluated at. 
 - 1 
 - 2 
 - 3 (Hype) 


To end the interaction, the user will press an aforementioned button when they are ready to end the interaction, or when they need to leave the room / house.
